To Track resources using AWS with Shell Script

A small script where using AWS, we'll be sharing resource usage of AWS Components like EC2, S3, Lambda, IAM etc. at a particular time to the reporting dashboard. Using a Cronjob.
#1: Create the EC2 instance with AWS and run in MobaxTerm (any OS) {if we need to use Linux in Windows - WSL can help as well.} and more.

**NOTE:** change your 'export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION' to your specific one.
