A small project where using AWS, we'll be sharing resource usage of AWS Components like EC2, S3, Lambda, IAM etc. at a particular time to the reporting dashboard.

Using a Cronjob.

#1: Create the EC2 instance with AWS and run in MobaxTerm (any OS)
{if we need to use Linux in Windows - WSL can help as well.}
